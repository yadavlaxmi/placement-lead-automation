# Telegram Job Scraper - Commented Files Documentation

## Overview

This document explains the newly created commented files for the Telegram Job Scraper system. These files provide enhanced documentation and job analysis capabilities.

## Files Created

### 1. `main_commented.py` - Fully Commented Main Application

This is a thoroughly documented version of the main application file with extensive comments explaining every component and function.

#### Key Features Explained:
- **Multi-Account Management**: Uses 4 Telegram accounts to distribute load and avoid bans
- **Universal Group Manager**: Ensures each group is assigned to only one account per day
- **Safe Joining Strategy**: Limits to 10 groups per account per day to stay within Telegram limits
- **Message Fetching**: Retrieves historical messages from joined groups
- **Job Classification**: Uses ML pipeline to identify job posts from regular messages
- **Email Notifications**: Sends daily job reports at 9 AM and 6 PM
- **Database Storage**: Stores all messages and metadata in SQLite database

#### Usage:
```bash
# Run the full system
python main_commented.py

# Run component tests
python main_commented.py test

# Show account reports
python main_commented.py report
```

### 2. `job_analyzer.py` - Job Channel Analysis Tool

This script analyzes existing channels to identify those with high job posting frequency (10+ job messages out of 100 total messages).

#### Key Features:
- **Smart Job Detection**: Uses keyword-based analysis to identify job messages
- **Channel Ranking**: Ranks channels by job message frequency
- **Flexible Analysis**: Supports different thresholds and time ranges
- **Export Options**: Generates JSON and CSV reports
- **Sample Messages**: Shows sample job messages for verification

#### Usage Examples:

```bash
# Basic analysis - find channels with 10+ job messages per 100
python job_analyzer.py

# Find channels with higher threshold (15+ job messages)
python job_analyzer.py --min-jobs 15

# Analyze only last 7 days
python job_analyzer.py --days 7

# Export results to CSV
python job_analyzer.py --export-csv

# Export detailed JSON report
python job_analyzer.py --export-json high_value_channels.json

# Analyze more messages per channel (200 instead of 100)
python job_analyzer.py --limit 200

# Use custom database path
python job_analyzer.py --db-path /path/to/custom/telegram_jobs.db
```

## Job Detection Algorithm

The job analyzer uses a sophisticated keyword-based algorithm to identify job messages:

### Keyword Categories:
1. **Job Indicators** (High Weight): hiring, job, vacancy, position, opening, opportunity, etc.
2. **Roles** (Medium-High Weight): developer, engineer, programmer, manager, analyst, etc.
3. **Technologies** (Medium Weight): python, java, react, aws, docker, etc.
4. **Locations** (Low Weight): bangalore, mumbai, remote, work from home, etc.

### Scoring System:
- Job Indicators: 3x weight
- Roles: 2x weight  
- Technologies: 1.5x weight
- Locations: 1x weight

A message is classified as a job post if:
- Confidence score > 10% AND at least one job indicator is present, OR
- Overall confidence score > 15%

## Sample Output

## Integration with Main System

The job analyzer complements the main system by:

1. **Channel Evaluation**: Identifies which joined channels are most valuable
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Tracks job posting frequency over time
3. **Resource Optimization**: Helps focus on high-value channels
4. **Quality Assurance**: Verifies that the system is joining productive channels

## System Architecture Benefits

### Ban Prevention Strategy:
- **Account Rotation**: 4 accounts distribute the load
- **Daily Limits**: Maximum 10 groups per account per day
- **Unique Assignments**: No duplicate group assignments
- **Human-like Behavior**: Realistic joining patterns

### Data Quality:
- **Message Classification**: ML-powered job post identification
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Universal group manager prevents redundancy
- **Historical Tracking**: Complete message history with timestamps
- **Account Attribution**: Track which account fetched each message

### Monitoring & Reporting:
- **Real-time Status**: Account join status and group assignments
- **Daily Reports**: Email notifications with job summaries
- **Performance Analytics**: Channel effectiveness analysis
- **Export Capabilities**: JSON and CSV data export

## Next Steps

1. **Run the Analysis**: Use `job_analyzer.py` to identify your most valuable channels
2. **Monitor Performance**: Check which accounts and channels are performing best
3. **Optimize Strategy**: Focus resources on high-value channels
4. **Scale Gradually**: Add more accounts if needed while maintaining safety limits

## Safety Considerations

- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in delays and limits to prevent bans
- **Account Health**: Monitor account status regularly
- **Group Diversity**: Join different types of groups to appear natural
- **Content Filtering**: Only store and analyze relevant job content

This system is designed to be both effective and safe, maximizing job discovery while minimizing the risk of account restrictions.
